# Socio-economic ontology

This ontology aims at including the concepts of the socio-economic domain useful in agrifood research. The first module focuses on the agricultural household surveys that yield important data and statistics on the socioeconomic status, production and food systems and environment of smallholders in the developing world. Its content is currently based on the 100 core questions developed by the CGIAR Socio-Economic Community of Practioce to be included in household surveys to collect consistent information on key socioeconomic indicators. The set of questions consists of the following sections: household composition and characteristics, farm characteristics, land availability and use, livestock availability and use, income and assets, gender, food security and dietary diversity, and other aspects (Van Wijk et al., 2019).  SEOnt will provide concepts and variables to the survey forms to annotate the data collected with the 100 questions, while taking into account the sensitive nature of the personal information.
